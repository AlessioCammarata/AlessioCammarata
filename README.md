## ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ About Me  
Iâ€™m passionate about automation, technology, and how different systems can communicate and work together.  
Currently, Iâ€™m contributing to [SquadraCorse Driverless](https://github.com/squadracorsedriverless), where I get hands-on experience with real-world engineering challenges.  

Outside of university, I enjoy experimenting with side projects, solving problems through code, and learning new tools to improve my workflow.
